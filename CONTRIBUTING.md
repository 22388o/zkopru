## Network security vulnerability

After the mainnet stage, you should not open up issues on Github to report bugs that can affect the network's security.
Mostly, it will be the case when you find some bugs in [`packages/contracts`](./packages/contracts) or [`packages/circuits`](./pacakges/circuits).
In this case, please report the bug via [zk-optimistic-rollup@ethereum.org](mailto:zk-optimistic-rollup@ethereum.org) instead of opening a public issue on Github.

## How to run tests

## Packages

### account

This module contains HD Wallet that manages zk accounts which supports both the Babyjubjub EdDSA and Ethereum.

### babyjubjub

This modules contains basic crypto classes for the babyjubjub elliptic curve to integrate its third pary libraries into the zkopru project.

### circuits

This library contains zk SNARK circuits written in Circom DSL.

### cli

Cli applications. Wallet and coordinator node.

### contracts

This library contains the smart contract which runs the upstream layer 1 part of the system. This library is written in solidity.

### coordinator

This is an application package for the coordinator. It synchonizes, verifies, and generates blocks with its full-node feature.

### core

The core layer2 blockchain system which supports both the full node and the light node. Using this package, you can develop a new application such as mobile wallets or payment solutions.

### dataset

This module generates dataset for test cases. To avoid the recursive dependency graph, only the test cases refer this package using symbolic links.

### integration-test

This module is the integration test set to run the local testnet for development.

### prisma

database layer.

### transaction

This modules contains the transaction builder.

### tree

This package contains a light weight roll up tree for zkopru system. Especially the light sync mode allows running the system with a very tiny size of tree data (~30 MB).

### utils

This package contains miscellaneous tools for zkopru project.

### zk-wizard

It contains a zk-wizard which creates a zk-SNARK proof for raw transactions and zk-wallet that manages the accounts and UTXOs.
