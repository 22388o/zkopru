## Network security vulnerability

After the mainnet stage, you should not open up issues on Github to report bugs that can affect the network's security.
Mostly, it will be the case when you find some bugs in [`packages/contracts`](./packages/contracts) or [`packages/circuits`](./pacakges/circuits).
In this case, please report the bug via [zk-optimistic-rollup@ethereum.org](mailto:zk-optimistic-rollup@ethereum.org) instead of opening a public issue on Github.
